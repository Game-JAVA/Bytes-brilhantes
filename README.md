<h3>Description</h3>

This game aims to defeat enemies until the boss arrives, where the final battle will take place. Inspired by the combat screen in Pokémon FireRed, you'll have a team of 4 heroes, each with their respective powers and abilities. In each combat you'll be able to strategically choose between one of them for battle.

<h3>Heroes</h3>

*Faria* 

This hero is a warrior who aims to protect his team and population, as he came from a war-torn village, and promised himself to protect the people. Trained for a long time by skilled masters, he acquired the talent of "dragon's fury", where he increases the damage of attacks 2x for three rounds. 

*Valentina* 

Because she has sorcerer parents, she has always had a very strong connection to the spirit world. With the ability to communicate with other spiritual planes, she was trained by an ancient and wise necromancer, where she became interested in the forbidden arts in which she learned and perfected her power to resurrect an ally every 2 rounds.

*Bruno* 

Because he had an affinity with the elements since he was a child, he decided to go deeper and make it his own. Taken to the elders, he learned more about his powers and had a highlight in his special ability the "fire tornado", a combination of the forces of wind and fire, having its charge every two rounds. 

*Leticia* 

Showing an exceptional talent from a young age for the manipulation of cosmic energies, she caught the attention of the wise astrologers, in which she took classes to further improve her powers, in which one of the healers saw an incredible potential and determined that she focus and make her special ability to stun her enemies at the time of battle, causing them to be 2 wheels without having enough strength to participate in combat.
